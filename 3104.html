     <h1>MKTG 3104- Marketing Management</h1>
     <h2>Prof. Wertalik</h2>
     <p>Marketing Management has been a great introduction into the world of marketing. It has been especially interesting comparing marketing techniues to PR techniques, as they do overlap quite a bit. In the class, we go over marketing techniques and terms that build a basis for future marketing information. We learn basic strategies and terms that are used in the marketing field that are necessary to know for further development.</p><p>Professor Wertalik is a very intersting instructor, opting for a very visual-based experience in her class. She utilizes current, real-world examples of the topics being covered to relay the information in a relatable way. She mixes lecture notes with videos, articles, and pictures to illustrate what she is saying throughout the lecture. She is very knowledgable and passionate about marketing, and has been involved in many well-known campaigns. She has a master's degree in marketing from Southern New Hampshire University as well as Virginia Tech. She focuses her studies on social media and current technology used in marketing.</p><p>I have throughouly enjoyed the class thus far, and expect to recieve an A in the class. I am very happy with the basis of knowledge the class has provided me, and I am excited to build upon this in future marketing classes.</p>
