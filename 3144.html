     <h1>COMM 3144- Writing and Editing for PR</h1>
     <h2>Dr. Woods</h2>
     <p>In Writing and Editing for PR, students learn how to write documents necessary for Public Relations. In addition to this, we learn how to structure our resumes, cover letters, and biosketches. This class has been very important in learning how to write news releases, backgrounder, crisis statements, and other documents. The class is also important in learning how to structure these papers and how to properly write them.</p> <p>Dr. Woods is a very knowledgable instructor that has been very tolerate and accomadating for her class. She is a very kind person that is very understanding in compromising situations. Dr. Woods has a PhD from the University of Kentucky with a masters from the University of North Carolina. She has experience in crisis communication and issues management. She also has experience in reputation management, a very important aspect of Public Relations.</p> <p>I am very happy with my progress in the class, and I am expecting to recieve either a B+ or an A-. I am happy with this class also because it has added documents to my portfolio, specifically news releases and other things. I also have a better crafted resume and cover letter, which is very beneficial for my future.</p>
