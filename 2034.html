     <h1>COMM 2034- Visual Media</h1>
     <h2>Dr. Evia</h2>
     <p>COMM 2034, Visual Media, is a very important class for my semester. While only a 2000 level course, the classs provides a challenging yet rewarding experience with Adobe software and basic HTML web design. Throughout the course, students learn how to use InDesign, Photoshop, which was expecially fun, Premiere, and HTML design. Through this, I have learned how to utilize these applications for different projects that I will be able to carry through to my future in the PR industry.</p> <p>Dr. Evia is a very emphatic instructor that allows each of us to lear at our own pace. He earned his PhD from Texas Tech University. He is now an associate professor of communications at Virginia Tech, with specialties in technical and professional writing, content strategy, and structured authoring. Dr. Evia is a pleasant teacher that is knowledgable in the areas he teaches.</p> <p>This course is important for communications students as it teaches the different Adobe softwares and webdesign techniques necessary for future development. I expect to get an A in the course, with hard work being put into each project. THroughout the semester, I have put forth effort into creating projects that I am proud of. </p>
